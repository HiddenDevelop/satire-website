                    NEW YORK – Yesterday, a follower of radical feminist philosopher and theologian Mary Daly published what many have referred to as the modern “Modest Proposal.” 
                    It has been subject to great controversy despite attempting to solve what she deems as “modern plagues.” 
                    These include domestic violence, racial discrimination, corruption, and of course gender inequality. 
                    Anyways, together let’s take a closer look at what Daly has to say.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    <em>
                        After reading thousands of articles written by prominent feminist figures, I have come to the inevitable decision to commence the creation of this proposal. 
                        Every day we are constantly bombarded by tons of dreadful news of women experiencing terrible acts of discrimination or oppression whether it is at home or at the workplace. For example,
                        last week, I came accross a news report about a 40-year old single mother who had been tirelessly working for the past 10 years with the hopes of obtaining a promotion; instead, the position that
                        was meant to be given to her was granted to a male employee that literally started working the day before. This lack of empathy further aggravated the despondent conditions endured by this woman who was 
                        simply trying to feed her 12 children. 
                    </em>

                <br>

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    <em>
                        In other similar situations, men have been the perpetrators of these forms of abuse. As a matter of fact, these brutes do not only limit their abuse to the opposite gender, but 
                        also tend to harm others of their same kind, sometimes for no logical reason. Throughout history, wars have been a common element between time periods, and have sprung from man's greed and unsatiable desire
                        for violence. But who are we to blame them, these poor creatures are born with abnormal levels of a hormone we all know as testosterone, 
                        which ultimately affects their ability to reason properly and control their intrusive thoughts.
                    </em>

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    <em>
                        Men are naturally inclined to adopt violent tendencies; It is an innate property embedded deep into their biological makeup. According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH), testosterone activates the subcortical areas of the brain to produce aggression, while cortisol and serotonin act antagonistically with testosterone to reduce its effects.

                        As shown in the graph above, the proportion of male offenders prosecuted for each offense group is significantly higher than that of females. Less imprisoned men would result in a lesser number of resources and money spent in prison maintenance. Eventually, this could potentially reduce the tax bills paid by responsible and righteous civilians.

                        Everyone knows that human reproduction is fully dependent upon the interaction between two individuals of the opposite sex. 
                        This unfortunate truth compels me to make the following proposition, although it may seem harsh by a few. 
                        After a male has reached sexual maturity, he must donate sperm and subsequently be eliminated, by means of lethal injection or otherwise.
                    </em>

                    <em>
                        There are various advantages to this solution:
                        Firstly, war will no longer plague the Earth; instead, conflicts and disagreements will be resolved through diplomacy and peaceful negotiation.
                        Secondly, women will be able to take on more prestigious jobs to fill the void left by the decrease in the male population.
                        Lastly, gender inequality won't be a pressing social issue as now only one sex will dominate above all: women.

                            Last year, the Robinson School administration approved the remodelation of flamboyan area. The tree by which the area gets its name 
                            is slowly rotting away, prompting its redecoration with new benches and a statue.. Rumors say that the statue might consist of a hawk or—although highly unlikely—of the high school principal Fortes.

                            other compulsory courses such as Gender Studies, Health Class, or Spiritual Life. Surprisingly, two days ago, a student fainted while reading his next assignment's instructions after pulling his third All-Nighter this week.
